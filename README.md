Welcome to the Rust & Graphics programming tutorial!

This repository is a collection of different programming exercises and learning materials(created by me) for learning the Rust programming language, and graphics programming in Rust. It is aimed towards beginners who are new to both Rust and Graphics programming, but are already experienced in programming in general.

It was originally created as a supplementary material for an offline study group preparing to attend SIGGRAPH Asia 2024, so the tutorial structure will be divided into separate weeks. Throughout the tutorial, we will first make ourselves familiar with Rust, and slowly delve into the world of graphics programming in Rust.

Note that this is by no means a complete introduction to both subjects! Treat this repository as an eye-opener for both Rust and Graphics programming to see if you are interested in learning more about them, and if you feel curious afterwards, you can refer to the additional learning materials listed in each week's `README`.

If you feel ready to go, you can start by diving into [week 1](/w1/README.md), and follow the instructions in the `README` file there. Good luck, and have fun!
