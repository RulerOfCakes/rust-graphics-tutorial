# Week 1 - Introduction to Rust & Graphics

Welcome to week 1!
We won't go too much into the basic syntax or concepts of the language, as there are plenty materials related to the subject. Refer to the prerequisites below for more absolute-beginner tutorials to kickstart your Rust journey.

# Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Experience in programming with at least one other programming language to at least an intermediate level
- Install [Rust!](https://rustup.rs/)
- Recommended: Complete [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), although excercises about threads and onwards are optional.

Also for this week, we will be touching a bit of Javascript and WebAssembly to visualize our results on the web. I will be providing most of the code regarding this part, but if you are absolutely new to JS, I recommend you to look into some basic tutorials.

## Recommended materials

These are optional materials that you can look into if you want to learn more about the topics we talk about this week.
